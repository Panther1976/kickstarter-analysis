# **Kickstarting with Excel**

## **Overview of Project**

To analyze the successes and failures of several thousand crowdfunding projects in order to gain insights that will increase the likelihood of success for Louise’s project. 

### **Purpose**

The Purpose of this analysis is to uncover potential trends from the successes and failures of several thousand crowdfunding projects. It is the hope that this will provide insights that will aid Louise in her own crowdfunding project to raise money for her play. Specifically looking at how the projects launch dates and goals impacted their successes and failures. 

## **Analysis and Challenges**

### **Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date**

This chart was created by referencing a pivot table that compiled and organized crowdfunding projects for plays by the months launched and the end results of the various campaigns. The Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date chart shows the relationship between the months that the crowdfunding projects were launched and their successes, failures, and cancellations. 

### **Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals**

This chart was created by referencing a pivot table that compiled and organized crowdfunding projects for plays by the campaign goal and the end results of the various campaigns. The Outcomes Based on Goals chart shows the relationship between the goal of the project and the percentage or likelihood of success.  The chart shows that the lower the goal seemed to indicate a stronger likelihood that the goal would be met and the more ambitious or higher the goal the less likely the goal would be met. 

### **Challenges and Difficulties Encountered**

One of the biggest challenges was the size of the data and the number of formulas needed to break it down. While the formulas are repetitive, a small mistake can inadvertently skew the data. Fortunately, we have worked with the data enough to have formed reasonable assumptions about how the data should translate into graphs. When the graphs didn’t meet my assumptions, I was able to uncover errors in my formulas. 

## **Results**

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The first conclusion that can be drawn from the data is that the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date line chart indicates that by far the months of May and June had the most successful launch dates. Secondly, the chart also indicates that launch dates in the months of November, December and January have a lower chance of meeting their goals. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The chart indicates that the most successful crowdfunding projects had a goal of approximately 4,000 or less. It also shows that the higher the goal the less likely it would be met. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Even though the time of the year may have had a real impact on these projects as indicated by the data, drawing conclusions based on launch date might be superficial. The projects themselves might have been unattractive to audiences or maybe different marketing opportunities were available at these times. In addition, concluding that the lower the goal, the more likely of success and that the higher the goal, the more likely it will fail is a bit generic. There does appear to be a somewhat significant level of success between the 35,000 and 45,000 range that could warrant further analysis. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Based on the level of success between the 35,000 and 45,000 range, I would like to investigate the launch dates of this particular population to further test the strength of the launch data as a indicator of success. Examining success and failure rates by genres and countries could also yield more telling information.
